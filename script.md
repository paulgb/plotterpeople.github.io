# Script for Plotter People #1

_This is a rough script for the first event._

## Start - 6:55pm
Hi folks! We'll be getting started in 5 minutes so find a seat over here and get cozy.

## Intro - 7:00pm
Thank you all for coming tonight! I'm Kyle and this is Jeremy. We're going to give you a quick overview of the event and then we'll get started with the talks.

A new creative community has been forming behind a hashtag on twitter — #plottertwitter — and Jeremy and I have been so encouraged by the positivity, the artistry, and the knowledge sharing that we've seen there. We're here to capture that IRL, and to give creative and technical people a chance to explore this stuff with us. I'm sure there are a few #plottertwitter regulars here tonight, but if you've never seen a pen plotter, or you've never created generative art before: you're in the right place. The talks tonight will be connecting us to the history of this very niche subject, and afterwards we'll be firing up a few machines to play with. We've also got art on display from local and international artists.

We'll be enforcing a Code of Conduct tonight which you can read on the website; here's the short version (point to slide on screen). We won't tolerate any kind of harrassment and our first job as organizers here is to make sure you feel safe. Please come talk to us if you see or hear anything inappropriate; if you can't find us, DM @plotterpeople on twitter; or if you need to report something anonymously, please text this number and we'll both get a notification.

Finally: thank you to GitHub for sponsoring this event, and thank you to Sher Minn, Lenore, and Windell, who all traveled to be here.

Over the next hour we'll hear from Sher Minn and Lenore, and then for the rest of the night we'll have an open floor with plotters running and food right over there (point to the food).

## Sher Minn's talk!
Jeremy will intro Sher Minn.

## Lenore's talk!
Jeremy will intro Lenore.

## Wrap-up - 8:00pm ish
Thank you again to Sher Minn and Lenore for being here tonight! The rest of the event will be pretty open-ended; Jeremy and I will be running plotters and answering your questions about tools and process and algorithms and whatever else is on your mind. We've got art on display, both framed and unframed; please don't touch it unless it's marked as something you can take. Also there's food! Just a note that the bar will not be available to us tonight---you might see some GitHubbers at the bar, but they can't pour you a glass. It's a legal thing.

We're excited to make this a regular event so tell us what you think and let us know how we can make this something you'll enjoy coming back to. If you've got an idea for a talk or there's a topic you're anxious to learn more about, tell us tonight or DM us on twitter.

Thanks!

# Notes

- Maybe a note towards the end about the table setup, if it ends up being precarious?
- We should leave a slide up at the end with names of all of the artists on display (and whatever other info is pertinent; website & twitter handle, maybe)
